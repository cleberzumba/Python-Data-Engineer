# Python-Data-Engineer
Data analysis and graph visualizations.

The ultimate goal is to show specific metrics in some chart views. A Dataset in CSV format contains data from candidates who participated in a company's selection processes (simulated data), and you will have to carry out some analyzes and manipulations based on this data.

I created a Python application to migrate data to a relational database. The database I chose was PostreSQL, which I installed, configured, created the database and created the database user. Additionally, I performed analysis and manipulation on the data and displayed this data from the database in graph visualizations; So, this data will be stored in a database and the reports will come from the database, not the CSV file.

The views are as follows:

- Hiring by technology (pie chart)
- Hires per year (horizontal bar graph)
- Hiring by seniority (bar chart)
- Hiring by country over the years (USA, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador only) (multiline graph)


## Technologies

Technologies I used:

-Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL database


## Data

I have 50 thousand rows of data about candidates. The fields I'm using are:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
-Country
- Application Date
- Yoe (years of experience)
- Seniority
- Technology
- Code Challenge Score
- Technical Interview
